						<p>Understanding Exposure & Why Art Photography PAGE 6 - 17</p>
					</header>

					<p>The first document, “Understanding Exposure”, introduces different aspects of exposure and the importance of lights in photo shooting. The author, Bryan Peterson, mostly focuses on the relationship between aperture, shutter speed, and exposure. He first defines exposure as “the amount, and act, of light falling on photosensitive material (either the digital card or film)” (14), and explains that the exposure should be “correct” - that is,  a simple combination of the “photographic triangle” - or better said, “creatively correct” (30), the one that makes the photo interesting among the different combinations of apertures and shutter speeds.</p>
					<p>He then goes on explaining the concepts of aperture - or the depth of field, “the area of sharpness within a photograph” (42) and the shutter speed that “controls the effect of motion” (80). Peterson also discusses different aspects of lights - for instance, the best light often occurs in the early morning or early evening (104), and different types of lighting including frontlight, overcast frontlight, sidelight and backlight. Lastly, he discusses the special techniques - the filters, the High Dynamic Range exposures (HDR), and the flash. </p>
					<p>This reading is really engaging and relatively easy to read as Peterson incorporates the photographs to support his ideas, which is really effective in demonstrating the relationship between aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, therefore helps me a lot in understanding the more technical concepts. I like how he stresses the importance of lights, as I personally believe that light and shadow plays a vital role in photography - that in some sense, photography can be seen as the art of light. His book also reminds me of a technique called Chiaroscuro, which is the use of strong contrast between light and dark - for instance, the Italian painter, Caravaggio, is known for the use of dramatic Chiaroscuro. In his paintings, he would vividly illustrate the scenes with meticulous use of lightings - while darkening the shadow, the subjects would nicely stand out in the light, just as shown in the artwork below.</p>

					<p>This technique is also commonly utilized in photography - for instance, Hernán Piñera, in his work “Airport”, incorporates a great use of light and shades - the strong contrast contributes to the tone while placing an emphasis on the objects, making this a beautiful shot of the scene at the airport.</p>
