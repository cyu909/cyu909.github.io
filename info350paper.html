						<h2>INFO 350 Paper #2</h2>
						<p>How can Tumblr’s policies support the law and support online consensual communities?</p>
					</header>

					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>Tumbler is a popular American social networking website that allows users to post multi-media content in the form of blogs. As a “global platform for creativity and self-expression”, Tumblr serves as a place for people to express and discover themselves. However, while privacy and freedom of speech has been fully supported, issues arise as inappropriate content appears; and regulations are needed in order to prevent online illegal acts. Therefore, in order to resolve the data problem of illegal acts online, it is vital to define what is ethical and the appropriate policies. </p>
					<br>
					<h3>I. The Information Policy</h3>
					<p>In response to the issue stated above, Tumblr has posted a series of community guidelines in an attempt to regulate the illegal content (See reference: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/community). While ensuring creativity and self-expression, this information policy defines multiple categories of illegal acts that will damage the community and jeopardize the users. It listed out a series of untolerated acts, including but are not limited to violence (terrorism, hate speech, harm to minors, etc), fraud, spam, copyright infringement, privacy violations, etc., and claimed that Tumblr will take actions upon when violation of guidelines is found.</p>
